      <br/><br/>
          <p>Through the act of creating a bibliography for a current internship, I found that a bibliography is more than an end-of-paper requirement for academic and professional writing. It is more than an afterthought, more than an add-on. A bibliography can be a thing in and of itself, a place to join all relevant sources on a particular topic. And when the topic at hand is the unfolding dialog surrounding a current event, the bibliography can simultaneously serve as a timeline.
          <br/><br/>
          When the <a href="https://babe.net/2018/01/13/aziz-ansari-28355" target="_blank">babe.net</a> article broke, first came an Atlantic article in response, then a Washington Post article, then a New York Times article, and another Atlantic article, and so on and so on. The articles referred to one another from the very beginning, making it necessary to backtrack a couple of articles to understand who was criticising or lauding which article. Both the content of and the dialog between the articles intrigued me, and I wanted to get a bird's eye view of this public conversation, so I created an unofficial bibliography, posted it to facebook, and solicited additions from others. The original public facebook post and subsequent discussion can be found <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sarahannadams/posts/10160035000035171" target="_blank">here</a>. I culled a large portion of the items posted on that discussion to create <a href="the-bibliography.html">the bibliography</a> page of this site, which is a work in progress, and subject to change.</p>

          <p>In addition to explaining the use of the word “microhistory” as a classification of this mini project, the <a href="related.html">related</a> page of this site presents two diagramming techniques that sparked my interest in thinking about the organization of claims, arguments, and opinions. As Pratt LIS student, I am often thinking about the organization of data and information, the first two levels of the traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid" target="_blank">DKIW pyramid</a> of Data, Inforamtion, Knowledge, and Wisdom. But what about the organization of arguments? Or opinions? Can we model a relational network of sources and each of their claims on a given topic? Could we use this process, or something similar, in modelling our own opinions on a topic by showing how we converge or diverge with others’ opinions?  With these examples in mind, I am interested in how components of these diagramming techniques could be applied to the comprehension of arguments from multiple sources on a given event - like the ones presented in this site’s bibliography - and also how the components could be used in creating a diagram of one’s own argument, or a diagram of the entire landscape of the arguments of a public dialog.</p>
