      <small><em><center>[thoughts as of 3/20/2018]</center></em></small><br/>

          <p>Having been assigned to create a bibliography for one of my internships, I learned that a bibliography isn't just a requirment to obligatorily tack on to the end of an academic paper. Rather, it can be an instructive tool in beginning to understand a topic at its <em>inception</em>, especially when orgainzed chronologically as a current event story unfolds.<br/><br/>

          When the babe.net article broke, first came an Atlantic article, then a Washiongton Post article, then a New York Times article and another Atlantic article, and so on and so on. Each article's tone seemed to proclaim superiority over the previous, exclaiming authoritatively "<em>I </em> am the hot take to end all hot takes!" The articles also refered to one another, making it neccessary to start with the earliest published articles to understand who was criticising or lauding which article. Both the content of and the dialog between the articles intruiged me, and I wanted to get a bird's eye view of the public conversation. This lead me to create a working bibliography, and post it to facebook, soliciting additions. The original public facebook post and subsequent discussion can be found <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sarahannadams/posts/10160035000035171" target="_blank">here</a>; parts of that post helped make up <a href="the-bibliography.html">The Bibliography<a> page of this site. Ultimately, I want to use this bibliography to understand the whole conversation - or as much as it that I can - and go through the excercise of writing down my personal thoughts. The <a href="editorial.html">Editorial<a> portion of this site will house those thoughts.<br/><br/>

          The <a href="related.html">Related<a> page catalogs projects and modes of thought that came up when ruminating about the creation of this site. As Pratt LIS student, I am often thinking about the organization of data and information, but what about the organization of arguments? The organization of opinions? Can we model the relationships between multiple sources making the same claim? And could this process be helpful in modelling our own opinions on a topic? I must admit that this is a selfish endeavor, for I am always trying to figure out the best way for me to <em> understand</em> why and how I think what I think. <br/><br/>
