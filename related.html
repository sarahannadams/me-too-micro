          <h5>According to Charle's Joyner's definition from <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/shared-traditions-southern-history-and-folk-culture/oclc/960179618&referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>Shared Traditions: Southern History and Folk Culture</em></a> - microhistories aspire to "[ask] large questions in small places". The label of a "microhistory" seemed applicable to this project, since I am looking into the conversations sparked by one babe.net story, and through those conversations, seek to ask bigger questions about consent, "bad dates", and what does and does not constitute sexual harrassment. 
          <br /><br />The photograph to the left is of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ginzburg" target="_blank">Carlo Ginzburg</a>, noted Italian historian and advocates of the microhistory. In 1993, Ginzburg wrote the 1993 article <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1343946?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank"><em>Microhistory, Two or Three Things That I Know about It</em></a>, which details the history of the use of the word microhistory in both academia and literature. </h5><br />

          <h5> The site <a href="https://www.kialo.com/explore" target="blank">Kialo</a> claims to be a <a href="https://www.kialo.com/tour/" target="_blank">"debate platform powered by reason" that makes it easy to "engage in focused discussion"</a>. After poking around the website, I must say I believe it has the potential to achieve that goal. The site presents a central argument, and users can add "pro" or "con" claims to that argument, each of which can branch off with their own "pro" and "con" claims. The network of claims relating to a central topic are visualized through each discussion's <a href="https://support.kialo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003878665-Statistics-and-the-Infographic" target="_blank">discussion topology infographic</a> and <a href="https://support.kialo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003878605-Argument-Tree" target="_blank">argument tree</a>. 
          <br /><br />
          In relation to the bibliographic sources listed for this microhistory, I am curious if - once a central argument is established - the structure of Kialo's topology infographic  could be used to model all of the arguments in the discussion surrounding Grace's experience with Aziz Ansari and <a href="https://babe.net/2018/01/13/aziz-ansari-28355" target="_blank">the babe.net</a> article itself. If this were possible, it could be an entirely new way for a "reader" to have access to the entire conversation at once, with the ability to zoom in and look at particular arguments, rather than having to piece everything together from different articles. 
          <br /><br />
          I don't necessarily believe that this "argument diagramming" is entirely practical on a mass scale due to its time-consuming nature, but in addition to being a tool that can allow an interested party to construct an in-depth representation of the facets of a partiular topic, I could also see this diagramming used in a school setting as a teaching tool or a project assigned to students to help them more fully understand a given topic.</h5><br />

          <h5>On October 21st, the Washinton Post published <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/10/21/the-cascade-of-missteps-that-turned-one-white-house-error-into-a-messy-week/?utm_term=.abe3c094c0a8" target="blank"><em>The Cascade of Missteps that Turned One White House Error into a Messy Week</em></a>, an article written by Phillip Bump that details what the Trump administration did and did not do after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/15/sahel-niger-us-special-forces-islamists" target="blank">four U.S. special forces were killed in Niger on October 4, 2017</a>. The article included a timeline that diagramed the events that occurred after the incident alongside the statements concurrently made by Trump and members of his administration. A direct link to the timeline image can be found <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fKMwTXotmxpiudtdM83nrIZ_M6o=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RGZ4KLFZZMYEFMENMTVRZK6AQI.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>. 
          <br /><br />
          This timeline diagram struck me because, in an era of "fake news", it is an accessible way to visualize what verifyably occured in comparison to what was being <em>said</em> about what occured. Displaying the different types of information with varying visual language - white for actual events versus blue for the commentary by Trump and his administration - made this representation of the incident more digestible than having to read a litany of "this happened, then he said, then she said" statements. 
          <br /><br />
          In relation to the organization of knowledge interest stated on the <a href="about.html">about</a> page of this site, I wonder if the components of this timeline diagram model could be transformed to help create an outline for a written argument, with the white boxes being references of other authors' statements, the blue boxes being the opinions or thoughts of the writer, and the vertical "time" component acting as the structure of the organizational flow of the piece of writing being constructed. </h5><br />
